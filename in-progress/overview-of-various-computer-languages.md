# Overview of Various Computer Languages

The purpose of this book is not to teach coding, and not even to teach the
indicated languages.  Rather, the book assumes familiarity with fundamental
programming skills, concepts, data structures, etc, as well as sufficient
familiary with syntax of one of the included languages from which you will be
able to make comparisons.  The purpose is to allow the reader to quickly develop
some familiarity with the syntax in these other languages, and to use this
familiarity to intuit more complex patterns based on their existing familiarity
with another language.

I am writing this for my own purposes, but I hope that others might find it
useful as a quick overview on which to expand their computer language literacy.

I will write using a first person perspective, in the hopes that this will be
more easily comprehended by my readers.

Please do not consider any of this to be complete in any way, and do not assume
that because you find it on the internet that you can trust its accuracy.  I am
a semi-skilled intermediate programmer at best, with a very limited knowledge of
most of the languages presented here.  While I have made a good faith effort to
provide a relatively thorough overview of each language, I do not have deep
familiarity or self-experience using these languages, and especially not
familiar with the specific paradigms common to the various languages.  I welcome
all comments, criticism, and pull requests that will ultimately help to make
this as accurate and useful a reference as possible.
